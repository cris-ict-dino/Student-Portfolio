                During my 9 years of school year, I participated in lots of community service including christmas gift box, community clean up, and teaching english to local students.
                I always work with responsibilities, if I get an opportunity to participate in such community sevices, I always work with my best.
                If I get any chance to participate in community sevices, I will never hesitate to do it.
