            <p>I had several opportunities to volunteer for different community service in school, and some outside school. If I get any opportunities to participate in any community services, I will work hard with passion, and will not hestate to spend much of my own time on it.</p>
            <p>I was involved in several community sevices in school, like help wrap up the Christmas gift box as a service team in out school for young children, I taught several young local students English, and I participated in community clean up service as a school member.</p>
            <p>In the future, I want to have more opportunities to participate in more community service, for example capstone projects. Not only for certificate or my resume, but I actually am passionate about helping others in different ways.</p>
