            <p>I currently have a total G.P.A of 4.0, and am planning on graduating with G.P.A higher than 4.0 with AP classes. I spend large amount of time on developing different skills, and learning new things.</p>
            <p>Despite my school performance, or school grades, I am planning and studying about my interests such as business and economics at the same time. I use my mean time during the weekend to learn things that I want, in different online resources and courses. </p>
            <p>I am planning on taking 4 or more AP exams, definitely including 2 AP economics (Micro, macro), 2-3 SATs, and Toefl. I am attempting to 4+ score in AP exams, and between 1300-1550 on SAT.</p>
