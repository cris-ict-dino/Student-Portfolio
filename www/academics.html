                I currently have a total G.P.A of 4.0, and am planning on graduating with G.P.A higher than 4.0 with AP classes. Despite my school performance, or school grades, I am planning and studying about my interests such as business and economics at the same time. I am planning on taking 4 or more AP exams, definitely including 2 AP economics (Micro, macro), 2-3 SATs, and Toefl. I am attempting to 4+ score in AP exams, and between 1300-1550 on SAT.
