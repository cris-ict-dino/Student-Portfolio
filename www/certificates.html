                For my 9 years of experience in this school, I earned different certificates in different areas. Some important ones are: High honor award for academically great students who got 4.0 + G.P.A, Participate certificate for football team, and great performance in fitness test. I will furthermore develop my skills in different areas and earn more certificates for next 3 years, including chapel band participation, and student council.
