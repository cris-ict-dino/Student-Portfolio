            <p>For my 9 years of experience in this school, I earned different certificates in different areas. I am attempting to participate in more events in different areas, and gain more of them.</p>
            <p>Some important ones are: Principle's List award for academically great students who got 4.0 + G.P.A, Participate certificate for football team, and volleybal team.</p>
            <p>Not only in school, but I will also learn different things outside of the school, such as online courses for business and marketing, and gain more certificates. </p>
            <p>I will furthermore develop my skills in different areas and earn more certificates for next 3 years, including chapel band participation, and student council. </p>
