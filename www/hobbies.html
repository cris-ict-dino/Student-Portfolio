            <p> I focused and continue to focus more on my future goals and academics, but at the same time, I developed lots of interests during my school life.</p>
            <p> I like the majority of sports, including football and volleyball, and I developed my skills and interests in these sports through sport programs in school.</p>
            <p>Also I enjoy playing instruments, especially guitar, I am not very talented or professional, but I will continue to develop more on this subject. Next year, I am planning on joining chapel band to develop my skills furthermore.</p>
