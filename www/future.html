            <p>
                I have a very strong desire for success. I didnâ€™t plan specific things for every situation in life yet, but I have planned briefly as a guideline. I want to join a ranked university in the United States with an advanced Business or Economic class. I am currently studying basics about business, finance, and also planning on taking AP Economics exams next year. I personally have lots of things that I want to do. I will start my own business, succeed, and work hard to gain all the things I want in life.
